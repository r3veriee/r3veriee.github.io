  <h2>The Mission of Scouting</h2>
  <p>
    To contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, 
    to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.
  </p>

  <h3>The Scout Promise</h3>
  <blockquote>
    On my honour I promise that I will do my best<br>
    To do my duty to God and the Republic of Singapore<br>
    To help other people and<br>
    To keep the Scout Law
  </blockquote>

  <h3>The Scout Law</h3>
  <ul class="scout-law">
    <li>A Scout is to be trusted</li>
    <li>A Scout is loyal</li>
    <li>A Scout makes friends, establishes and maintains harmonious relations</li>
    <li>A Scout is disciplined and considerate</li>
    <li>A Scout has courage in all difficulties</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Scout Motto</h3>
  <p><strong>"Be Prepared"</strong></p>
  <p class="quote">
    ‚ÄúBe Prepared... the meaning of the motto is that a scout must prepare himself by previous thinking out 
    and practicing how to act on any accident or emergency so that he is never taken by surprise.‚Äù<br>
    - <em>Lord Baden-Powell</em>

            <h2>The Scout Movement</h2>
            <p>
                The Scouting Movement began in 1907 when Lieutenant General Robert Baden-Powell organized the first
                experimental camp on Brownsea Island, England. The camp, which hosted 20 boys from diverse social
                backgrounds, tested ideas that would later be published in his seminal book, <a href="http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/yarns00-28.pdf"><em>Scouting for Boys</em></a>.
                This publication laid the foundation for a worldwide youth movement that emphasized outdoor activities,
                moral values, leadership, and self-reliance.
            </p>

            <p>
                The core principles of Scouting are encapsulated in the Scout Promise and Law, which promote duty to
                God, loyalty to one's country, helping others, and personal integrity. The movement is non-political and
                open to all, regardless of race or creed. It fosters holistic development through learning-by-doing,
                leadership opportunities, service projects, and nature-based experiences.
            </p>

            <h3>Growth and Global Reach</h3>
            <p>
                From its British roots, Scouting spread rapidly across the British Empire and beyond. By 1920, the first
                World Scout Jamboree was held in London, gathering over 8,000 Scouts from around the globe. The World
                Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) was formed in 1922 to coordinate international efforts. As of
                today, Scouting boasts over 50 million members across more than 170 countries.
            </p>

            <h3>Objectives of the Scout Movement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual potential.</li>
                <li>Foster teamwork and leadership through patrol-based systems.</li>
                <li>Promote environmental stewardship and sustainability.</li>
                <li>Instill a lifelong commitment to service and citizenship.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Singapore Scouting</h3>
            <p>
                Scouting arrived in Singapore in 1910, just three years after the movement began. It was introduced by
                Frank Cooper Sands and began with the establishment of the first Scout troop at Raffles Institution.
                Known as the ‚ÄúFather of Scouting in Singapore,‚Äù Sands laid the groundwork for what would become a vital
                national institution. Today, the Singapore Scout Association operates under the Ministry of Education
                and the World Scout Movement, offering programs for Cub Scouts, Scouts, Venture Scouts, and Rover
                Scouts.

            <h2>Troop Hierarchy & Activities</h2>

            <h3>üü• National-Level Structure (Singapore Scout Association)</h3>
            <p>
                The Singapore Scout Association (SSA) is structured to deliver both national strategy and grassroots
                execution. It includes formal leadership roles, councils, commissioners, and operational units.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chief Scout:</strong> The President of Singapore serves as the ceremonial head and grants
                    warrants and major awards to adult leaders and commissioners.</li>
                <li><strong>Scout Council:</strong> Composed of both uniformed and lay officials, this council provides
                    strategic direction and financial oversight for the entire Association.</li>
                <li><strong>Commissioners' Council:</strong> Develops and enforces operational policies, training
                    standards, and programmatic direction across all scouting sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Headquarters Staff:</strong> A professional administrative team that supports logistics,
                    finance, records, and day-to-day operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership Academy:</strong> The national center for leadership development, responsible for
                    designing and delivering structured training to leaders and adult volunteers.</li>
                <li><strong>Chief Commissioner:</strong> The highest-ranking uniformed officer overseeing all aspects of
                    SSA operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Deputy and Assistant Chief Commissioners:</strong> Each responsible for a key portfolio such
                    as youth program, training, or administration.</li>
                <li><strong>National Training Commissioner:</strong> Oversees all adult training programs and ensures
                    compliance with global standards.</li>
                <li><strong>National Programme Commissioner:</strong> Designs and manages the youth progression and
                    badge frameworks.</li>
                <li><strong>International/Relations Commissioner:</strong> Manages relationships with other National
                    Scout Organizations, WOSM, and oversees international exchanges and jamborees.</li>
                <li><strong>Area and District Commissioners:</strong> Implement policies and coordinate scouting
                    activities within their assigned regions (areas and districts).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These leadership levels ensure that national goals align with grassroots delivery and that policies are
                properly implemented across all groups.
            </p>

            <h3>üü¶ Unit-Level Structure (Troop & Patrol System)</h3>
            <p>
                At the unit (e.g., troop) level, leadership is youth-centered, guided by trained adult leaders. The
                system is based on empowering Scouts to lead and work collaboratively through patrols.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Group Scout Leader (GSL):</strong> The overall adult leader who oversees the entire scout
                    group (which may include Cubs, Scouts, Ventures, and Rovers).</li>

                <li><strong>Assistant Troop Leaders (ATLs):</strong> Support the TLs in managing logistics, training,
                    and Scout welfare.</li>
                <li><strong>Senior Patrol Leaders (SPLs):</strong> Experienced youth leaders who coordinate activities
                    across different patrols, often mentor newer Scouts.</li>
                <li><strong>Patrol Leaders (PLs):</strong> Lead a group of 6-8 Scouts (a patrol), delegate tasks, and
                    ensure everyone participates in activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Assistant Patrol Leaders (APLs):</strong> Support the PL and assume leadership when the PL
                    is absent or needs help.</li>
                <li><strong>Quartermaster:</strong> Responsible for maintaining, organizing, and issuing the troop's
                    camping and activity equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Secretary:</strong> Keeps meeting minutes, attendance, and troop documentation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>üü® Key Leadership Functions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Chief Scout:</strong> Officially endorses leadership appointments (warrants) and awards
                    adult recognitions.</li>
                <li><strong>The Scout Council:</strong> Ensures activities are aligned with the SSA's mission, vision,

                    mentorship to unit-level leaders.</li>
                <li><strong>Troop-Level Leaders:</strong> Facilitate weekly meetings, campouts, progress reviews, badge
                    testing, and Scout welfare.</li>
            </ul>
